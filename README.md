# Xpress-project
Xpress project deals with creating a website and an app called Chakula Express which is a cutting-edge food and grocery delivery platform designed to connect customers with their favorite restaurants and trusted supermarkets like Shoppers and Max. Our easy-to-use app and website allow users to browse menus and products, place orders, and soon, track deliveries in real time.

Whether you're craving a meal or shopping for groceries, Chakula Express ensures fast delivery through a verified network of drivers. Restaurants can efficiently manage incoming orders and receive clear payment breakdowns between them, our platform, and the delivery partners.

Chakula Express is the smart, seamless way to get what you need â€” when you need it.
